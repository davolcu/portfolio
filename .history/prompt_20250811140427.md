I want to build my own website. I'm a senior frontend engineer and you can find my Linkedin profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-olmos-b99452138/

You can also find my public projects in my github profile: https://github.com/davolcu?tab=repositories

My website should be build using Astro as the main framework, and using their website as the main source of styling: https://astro.build/
I want the website to be flashy and creative, this modern vibing
